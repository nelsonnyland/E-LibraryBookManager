Your task for this assignment will be to create a data-driven project and implement CRUD functionality 
for an entity. This can also be used as a start for the team project. If you do not finish the entire 
CRUD functionality by the due date that is okay as long as your team is working. 

**You will be split into teams:**

* One team member should create a GitHub repo and add the other team member(s) as a contributor.
* One team member should start the project and commit the initial project to the repo.
* Tasks should be split into separate issues and the team should determine how to split up the work.
* While working, each member should work in their own branch. Once an issue is completed, the team 
  members branch can be merged into the master.
* Keep track of your time as I will want a recap of how you spent your time on the project.
